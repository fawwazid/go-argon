# Security policy

## Current contract

Only Argon2id version 19 is accepted. Salt length is at least 16 bytes and
key length at least 32 bytes in both creation and verification. PHC encodings
must be canonical. There is no mode selector, Argon2i execution path, or empty
mode fallback. Bound concurrent hashing and benchmark the configured cost.
Argon2 operations return ErrFIPSUnsupported whenever FIPS mode is enabled.
Parameter inspection is not a cryptographic operation.

This release removes source and behavior compatibility with the APIs listed
under Breaking changes in README.md. Unsupported inputs are rejected.
Applications must replace unsupported records or enrollments before upgrading;
this library does not provide conversion or permissive verification helpers.

## FIPS deployment

This library is not independently FIPS 140-3 certified. Deployment compliance
depends on the validated Go module, its approved operating environment,
security policy, and application controls. A library cannot enable FIPS mode
for its caller.

The baseline is Go 1.27.3. The frozen Go module v1.0.0 corresponds to
[CMVP certificate 5247](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cryptographic-module-validation-program/certificate/5247),
checked active on 2026-10-24. Review certificate status and operating-environment
coverage before deployment. A consuming application can build with
GOFIPS140=v1.0.0 and must not override it with fips140=off.
The strict only setting below is an assessment aid, not a production setting.

## Verification

Ordinary checks:

```sh
go mod verify
go vet ./...
go test ./...
go run golang.org/x/vuln/cmd/govulncheck@v1.9.0 ./...
```

Dedicated policy tests with the frozen module:

```sh
GOFIPS140=v1.0.0 GODEBUG=fips140=on go test -count=1 -run FIPS ./...
GOFIPS140=v1.0.0 GODEBUG=fips140=only go test -count=1 -run FIPS ./...
```

In PowerShell, set the variables with
`$env:GOFIPS140 = 'v1.0.0'` and `$env:GODEBUG = 'fips140=on'` or
`'fips140=only'`, then run the go test command. Restore the original environment
after checking.

CI is configured for Windows and Linux, including Linux race detection.
Local validation is limited to the platform and commands actually executed;
see the workspace SECURITY_REVIEW.md for the recorded results.
